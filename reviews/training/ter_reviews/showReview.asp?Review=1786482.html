			There are just some ladies who you know you are going to click.  That is how it was with Gizelle.  She is a bit on the feisty side and you can just tell she is a hot blooded latina who is a strong and determined woman.  I find those woman are often extremely passionate lovers as they bring high energy and intensity to what they do.  Easy to set up once the time matches with her schedule.   Met her in the morning and we were both fresh and ready, but I do think she was more ready than me.....  The woman has a great collection of lingerie and I had asked for something sexy.  She was wearing a shear body suit type outfit trimmed in leopard print and it showed off her amazing breasts very nicely.  One look at her and I just knew I was in for a great time.

		<div class="content-layout-area-title"><div class="content-layout-area-title-inner"><h2>The Juicy Details</h2></div></div>
		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    She also had on heels and that hot image is now permanently etched into my brain....She greeted me with a really nice and intense kiss and I almost dropped the Starbuck's I had brought her. Set the cups down and we engaged in some pretty hot and heavy kissing and me cupping her breasts and grabbing her ass.  The woman has a great body and I planned to explore every inch of it.<br>
<br>
It was very obvious that this woman is a pleaser, as from the first moment, all she wanted to do was make sure I was enjoying my time. As I am fondling and groping her, enjoying her soft and smooth skin, she is rubbing the front of my pants and trying to removing them so she could get full access to my cock.  No wasted chit chat or spending extensive time getting to know each other (although I had emailed and texted her and we were already pretty comfortable with each other)   I could tell she really was going to do me right. Decided to just let the coffees go cold and got naked and we really got down to business. <br>
<br>
I caressed and stroked her body and she is extremely sensitive to the touch...I could feel goose bumps all over and I could tell she was stimulated by my hands and fingers. But I moved down to those great all natural breasts and enjoyed the cleavage. Nice, sensitive nipples and I spent time licking and sucking them.   But it was time to move further downward. <br>
<br>
I spent some nice time with daty....she seemed to enjoy my efforts but didn't get her to an O. But she was definitely intent on getting to my cock and I finally relented and just let her have her way with my manhood. She has excellent oral skills and she took very good care of the boys as well. Lots of ball licking and sucking and she really knows how to intensify the sensation with her tongue. As I had 60 minutes I slowed her down as we were moving too close to me getting my first pop....when I was rock hard, I asked her to ride me....wow...what can I say. She climbed aboard and rode me CG, squatting CG, reverse CG. The woman just kept me up and she was bucking and moving as my cock was enjoying her tightness and wetness. I am pretty sure this lasted at least 20 minutes and we were both drenched in sweat. She looked at me and complimented me on my staying power...lol. (definitely scored points with this old geezer when she told me I was like a much younger man). Glad I was able to keep it up and let her enjoy a nice ride. She said she needed a quick cool down and we cuddled a bit and chatted about life. But before long she initiated more contact and we moved to missionary and then to doggie before she climbed back on and rode me again CG. I had told her I had a bad knee...Gizelle was totally up to make it good and said we didn't need to do anything that might hurt my knee, so no positions where my knee could give way. <br>
<br>
I had really enjoyed her oral skills and decided I wanted her to finish me that way. Removed the glove and she took me deep over and over again, cupping my balls. She then gave me a hand job while sucking my balls into her mouth.  She licking all around my balls and her tongue felt amazing.   Back to bj and hj and I blew a nice load. She got up to get a warm cloth to clean me up (nice touch and I do find many of the ladies do NOT take care of the clean up with a warm cloth rather they use wipes or just a cold washcloth). We chatted some more, spent more time groping and fondling and I left with a nice smile on my face. I think she was disappointed I didn't get a second pop, but she had me rock hard and riding for such a long time and it was amazing fondling those breasts while she rocked and thrusted downward on my cock. I sure got my money's worth of stimulation. <br>
<br>
She is not a clock watcher and I was the one who keep checking the time. Gizelle is a total sweetheart and a lady who really seemed like she was there for MY pleasure.   I will definitely repeat with this lady.  She is not a immature 20 something...rather she is an experienced woman who really knows how to please a man.  Great breasts that I think I could spend an entire hour enjoying...but definitely you want to enjoy the rest of her skills.  I got the impression she would have done whatever it took to get me to the promised land....and there was no quit with this lady...  A real pro who knows what she is doing and totally delivers.  Thanks, Gizelle, you were great!!!<br>
