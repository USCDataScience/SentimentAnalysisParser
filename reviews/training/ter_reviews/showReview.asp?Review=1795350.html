			Carli has been on my radar for some time.  In fact, I had attempted to meet with Carli previously, twice, but it never worked out until now.  I booked a 2-hour session with Carli and booking was, as usual, a breeze with her booker - Joey.<br>
<br>
I usually don't book anything less than 2 hours, even with repeats, unless I'm really crunched for time.  In which case, I book 1.5 hours.  Otherwise, I simply don't book.  I don't like to rush things; I like to let things develop naturally, and the sex is amazing when that happens.  And, a certain bond is developed during the course.  As I approach 50, in addition to the sex, I also enjoy meeting and spending time with people.  I cherish our time and experience together.  To each our own kind of thing I guess.  Anyways...<br>
<br>
Carli kept me informed as to how far she was from the hotel I was staying at.  I gave her my room number.  She called me once she'd parked at the hotel only to tell me that she needed card access to enter the building.  I asked her to drive to the lower level parking and meet me there.  I saw a beautiful girl in tights jeans and a black top walking towards me.  My heart was racing.  We did a quick short hug and a peck on the cheek and went towards the elevator to go to our room.<br>
<br>
Non-VIPs: get in line before the line gets long.  First, Carli is an awesome girl.  Second, she's the definition of GFE.<br>
<br>
P.S. Just so you know, I ended up extending our session to 4 hours (from 2 hours).  Yes, she was that good.<br>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content-layout-area content-layout-area-review-details">
		<div class="content-layout-area-title"><div class="content-layout-area-title-inner"><h2>The Juicy Details</h2></div></div>
		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    Carli looked awesome in that body hugging clothes.  After we entered the room, we embraced each other for a long hug and a few pecks on the cheek and lips. She excused herself to the restroom to freshen up while I looked outside through the window to enjoy the beautiful afternoon fall weather.<br>
<br>
We started with LFK which then led to DFK.  She smelled great and her breath smelled great, too.  I love to DFK and so fresh breath is a must.  We kissed, and kissed for an extended period of time.  Sometimes gently and sometimes hard.  Carli's lips were fully pout and I sucked it even more.  I slowly removed her top and her breasts looked great resting on the black bra.  The bra came off in no time and exposed a set of beautiful natural DDs.  She got on top of me and rested them on my chest.  I lifted her up and pulled her towards me, so I could suck on them, and cup as much as I could with my wide open mouth.  Carli continued raining kisses everywhere on me and I continued to enjoy her lips and breasts.<br>
<br>
I then brought Carli to the side of me and reached inside her tight jeans with both my hands.  One hand through the front and other through the back of her jeans.  I was able to easily glide a finger in her wet pussy from the back while I played with her clit from the front.  Carli's eyes were closed, but I could tell she was enjoying it.  I started slow and increased the pace gradually.  Still with her jeans on and one finger buried deep inside her tight pussy from the back while the other hand was playing with her clit from the front.  Her breathing accelerated.  Carli's body was squirming in anticipation and build up of an orgasm.  As the intensity rose, she had both her hands in her mouth, trying to suppress her scream, as a result of what was about to erupt.  Her legs shivered and her body shuddered as she climaxed.  And, watching her cum was a sight to behold.  I held her close to me, as we snuggled and laid there a few minutes.  I was spooning her; with my arms around her and each palm cupping a breast.<br>
<br>
We took a break to have some wine (her) and beer (me).  Our 2-hour mark was up and her phone rang.  I asked our time be extended by a couple of hours to 4 hours.  I'm glad she was able to.<br>
<br>
We repeated the same as above, sans the jeans.  Again, she looked amazingly beautiful as she came.  Her face was blushing red from the orgasm and I loved how she looked.  I held that beautiful face and DFKed for a while.<br>
<br>
It was time to return the favor.  She kissed me from the top and slowly worked her way down.  She unzipped my pants and kissed on the tip of my hard cock over the underwear.  She moved her lips and kissed over the contour of the cock from top to bottom.  She removed my pants and continued to kiss my cock over my underwear.  It was as if she was making love to it.  She then slowly peeled the underwear from the top and licked the tip; swirled her tongue around the head and licked up all the precum.  She continued the cock worship; alternating between sucking and licking.  She pulled my underwear all the way down so she could have full access to a fully erect, hard cock.  Carli took it deep and kept it there for a while.  She could feel my cock pulsating deep inside of her mouth.  I could see her lips pout as she slowly released my cock.  The sight of Carli sucking my cock so artfully and sensually, and the sheer delight with which she did, I couldn't hold it any longer.<br>
<br>
I came...<br>
She had me in her mouth as I came...<br>
She swallowed every drop of cum as I came...<br>
And she continued to suck my cock ever so gently after I came...<br>
<br>
Carli rested her beautiful face next to my throbbing cock, and every now and then she would move her face to kiss my cock with her beautiful lips.  She stayed that way - with her face on my cock - for a few minutes.  I then pulled her up and held her tight against my chest.  What a fantastic orgasm I had.  I kissed her on the forehead in appreciation, and got up to grab another beer.  She excused herself to freshen up again.  Another quality that I love in women - freshening up after a round.<br>
<br>
I still had a bit over an hour left.  I could have gone for the 2nd round, but I didn't want to rush it.  I wanted to make love to this beautiful young women.  So, I decided to chat about things in general.  She's a good conversationalist and can speak to any topic.  We drank more and said goodbye after our time was up.<br>
<br>
An amazing 4 hours with an awesome girl / human being.<br>
<br>
As always, spend the time to get to know the girl and have the right attitude.  And what follows will be amazing as a result.<br>
<br>
Carli is a gem of a girl and is a definite repeat for me.<br>
