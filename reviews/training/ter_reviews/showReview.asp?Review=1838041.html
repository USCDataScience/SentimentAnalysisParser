			This was my second time visiting J Lyeen. The PO is very professional and helpful. Directions were are always very clear. The area is very discrete and parking is was never a problem. Being in the valley is also a plus as it is much closer to me than other Kgirls in WLA and traffic is never that bad. I arrived and went up after receiving a text saying that J Lyeen is ready and the door opened. This was very memorable hour. J Lyeen is the best provider I have seen in terms of looks and performance but most importantly she was much more passionate during our time than any other provider and I'm gutted that she left. If she comes back, make sure to see her, I know I will.

		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    J Lyeen has a very beautiful face and a great body. The only reason I gave her a 9 instead of a 10 is because her implants are very hard and her ass is a little small, but apart from that she is a gem. <br>
I had asked for J Lyeen to wear yoga pants and a sports bra and that's exactly what she was wearing. She greeted me with a DFK and then we headed for the bedroom after I handed the donation. She was about to take her clothes off for the shower but I told that I had already showered and sat her next to me on the bed. We went onto a make out frenzy. Very intense DFK with lip biting. We were still fully clothed and grinding against each other. I slightly pulled her pants down and started licking her every where finally getting to her beautiful shaved pussy. She was very responsive as I kept eating her pussy until she got very moist then I started fingering her while we DFK. By this point I was very hard so I was taking my clothes off in a rush while she was grabbing a condom. We started fucking hard in mish while her legs were still bound by the pants. She was scathing my back and lightly choking me as I was her. She was moaning all the time we were fucking and I felt a lot of convulsions and thought she came a few times but then again these girls can be pretty damn well actresses. We Then we moved on to ds. Then flat ds where she arched her back allowing me to reach under her and rub her clit while we were fucking. I then grabbed her and we got off the bed. She was having trouble moving as the yoga pants were below her knees by now (yes, she was still in her clothes). I started fucking her against the wall with one hand around her neck and the other rubbing her pussy. I then backed up to lean on the bed and she backed up with me careful not to let my cock slip out of her tight pussy. She held my knees and started fucking me by moving fast up and down my cock until she got tired. I then took her clothes off and sat her on that high chair in her room. I started fucking her again while we intensely kiss. I then held on to the chair and went as fast and hard as I possibly can until she was moaning very loudly and I felt the convulsions again and started kissing her. I was concerned that we might run out of time and I'm yet to cum so I checked the time and only 25 minutes had gone by. We then changed positions with me on the chair and she is on her knees licking my balls while taking the condom of my cock. She gave me a very enthusiastic BBBJ with lots of saliva and BLS but no real deepthroating. I then pushed her head slightly down and she pushed my legs back and started to vigorously rim me. She lubed my dick and started jerking me with 2 hands while licking my asshole until I exploded inside her mouth. She kept my dick inside her mouth for awhile and she didn't go the bathroom to clean up so I'm assuming she swallowed. She then offered a massage which was mediocre but it doesn't matter as that's not what I'm there for. It just gave me a chance for a quick nap before round 2 which started with reciprocal orals and followed similar to round 1. We showered and got dressed. She gave me a kiss at the door and said she'll miss me. I told her I'll see her later having no idea that she'll be gone short after. I was out only a couple of minutes overtime. She was very passionate during our time. We were somehow kissing in every position we did and she didn't mind at all that I was a little bit rough and went completely off script and led the session. I'm dying to see her again and I'm relentlessly checking if she is coming back. If she comes back and you're able to see her don't hesitate.
