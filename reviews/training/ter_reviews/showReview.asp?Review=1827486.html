			I will absolutely see Farrah again... as often as possible!!!  Wow.  She is a true professional who enjoys what she does. And she has a stunningly beautiful face.<br>
<br>
I contacted Farrah by e-mail.  She responded in 2 hours, 15 minutes. Verification was easy.  I asked for a 90 minute outcall to my place in Titusville, which is about a 40 minute drive from her place.  She had no problem with the distance and even refused to accept something extra for her driving time.  I told her that I am flexible with times and dates, so she gave me several days/times when she was available.  I chose Wednesday at 8:30pm.  She provided her phone number via e-mail.<br>
<br>
We e-mailed and texted quite a bit over the next several days... even joking with each other about a variety of things.  She's very friendly, polite, and writes well.  She's obviously a very intelligent lady.  I asked her what she likes to drink and what she would like for snacks.  She was very specific that she likes Moscato D'Asti (carbonated Moscato wine) and strawberries/raspberries.<br>
<br>
She arrived perfectly on-time.  I really appreciate that.  She was wearing a very nice black cocktail dress and high heels.  She has a gorgeous face... definitely her best asset.  I think she's a little taller than she advertises (her website says 5'2").  She's probably about 5'4" or 5'5".<br>
<br>
During our e-mail conversation, she asked me if I had a preference as to what she should wear. I half-jokingly told her to wear a catholic school girl uniform, complete with plaid skirt... and then I told her to just wear whatever she wanted.  I must admit that I would have LOVED IT if she arrived wearing a plaid skirt and a white blouse... but she looked fantastic in the black cocktail dress.<br>
<br>
For the non-VIP's, I can only say this... she is eager to please... very, very eager.  I actually felt like she was my girlfriend.  That's a rare thing to find.<br>
<br>
VIP's... read on!

		<div class="content-layout-area-title"><div class="content-layout-area-title-inner"><h2>The Juicy Details</h2></div></div>
		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    When she arrived, she looked great in a black cocktail dress and high heels... and wow, what a beautiful face!  <br>
<br>
I had placed a plate of strawberries, raspberries, and a sweet fruit dip on my dining table... and a plain white envelope next to the plate. I asked her if she would like some berries while I poured two glasses of wine. She happily ate some berries while I poured the wine... and she didn't touch or mention the envelope until she was ready to leave. I appreciate her professionalism.<br>
<br>
In my kitchen, I handed her a glass of wine and we clinked our glasses before taking a sip. Then we walked to my living room and sat on the couch. We sipped our wine and chatted. She is a very kind, intelligent, beautiful woman. After only a few minutes of conversation, she moved closer to me and started to kiss me. It is a pleasant surprise when a woman makes the first move!<br>
<br>
At first, we started with some light kissing and progressed to LFK. I gently guided her to a standing position so that we could continue kissing. We gradually progressed to DFK. Kissing is very important to me. It is the "spark" which "lights my fire." She's a good kisser (maybe a 7.5 on a 1-10 scale)... definitely enough to make Mr. Happy stand at attention! And then she surprised me!!!<br>
<br>
She turned around... with her back to me... her ass rubbing against my cock... and she leaned her head back so that I could continue kissing her! That was SOOOO sexy! We began to kiss deeper in this position as I instinctively reached around to caress her thigh and made my way up to massage her clit through her panties. She let out a little moan of appreciation.<br>
<br>
Then, she spun around again to face me... and helped me to remove my pants, dropped to her knees and began to vigorously suck my cock. I now understand what others were talking about when they mention her eyes... especially when she looks up at you with your cock in her mouth. Wow.<br>
<br>
She spent at least 10 minutes in that position, and she didn't mind when I put my hand on the back of her head and fucked her face. I enjoyed the glock-glock-glock sound as I pounded her face with my cock. Even when I forced my cock into her throat and HELD it there for a few seconds, there was no resistance from her. We moved to the bedroom with more of the same. This girl is a champ!<br>
<br>
After more time on her knees sucking my cock, I guided her to lie on her back on the edge of the bed, and proceeded to lick and suck her pussy. She keeps her kitty clean. It tastes and smells perfect. She is very vocal, but I doubt that her vocal responses are genuine. Hopefully, with time, she feels confident enough to guide me to help her to achieve a genuine orgasm. Nevertheless, I truly enjoyed my time with her.<br>
<br>
We moved on to "69", and I really loved the way that she licked and sucked my cock and balls... while I enjoyed licking and sucking her sweet pussy.<br>
<br>
Then, we moved to doggy-style. As I reached my climax, I told her that I wanted to cum in her mouth. She gladly accepted! I pulled off the condom while she got on her knees. She allowed me to fuck her face as I came. She swallowed every drop! This is a HUGE turn-on for me. She is a rare find.<br>
<br>
I was still hard after she swallowed my cum! So I put on another condom and positioned her on her back... fucking her while holding her legs up on my shoulders. Eventually, I lost my erection... <br>
<br>
Then, we moved back to the couch. We chatted for a while. As we spoke, she started to kiss me again... caressing my cock, and massaging my balls... getting me hard... sucking my cock... and back to the bedroom for more amazing sex.  She rode me in CG and Asian CG.<br>
<br>
We went through several positions. She has an incredible ability (and desire) to please me. She initiated the foreplay, kissing, etc. every time during the encounter. Honestly, this woman is amazing. I will continue to see her every chance I get.<br>
<br>
At one point, I wanted to take a trip to Greece... and we tried, but I just couldn't manage to get inside her tight ass.  We'll work on that more next time!  So, then I lay on the bed while she sucked my cock. I asked her to suck my balls, and she did a great job at that while simultaneously stroking my cock. It felt fantastic.<br>
<br>
There is room for improvement in her oral technique. She sucks hard and fast, and while I enjoy that... it would be nice if she slowed down sometimes and moved her tongue around the bottom of my cock... and sometimes just licking and sucking the head. Now that I know that I can trust her, I will feel more comfortable to tell her exactly what I want during our next visit.  I have no doubt that she will be happy to do whatever I ask.<br>
<br>
This woman is awesome. She's a keeper.
