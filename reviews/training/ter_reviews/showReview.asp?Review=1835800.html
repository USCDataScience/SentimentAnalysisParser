			I had tried once before to set something up with Samantha, unfortunately my schedule did not allow for us to meet. I tried again about two weeks later.  Both times she was very responsive and the whole thing was set up via texting. The first time she was staying in a hotel. This time she had her own place, definitely a better option. She's also willing to do outcalls she says, although, she may need a ride. I'll have to try that out sometime.  At any rate, she is a sweet and kind young lady, that looks like her pictures and provides a very nice service. I will probably repeat.

	<div class="content-layout-area content-layout-area-review-details">
		<div class="content-layout-area-title"><div class="content-layout-area-title-inner"><h2>The Juicy Details</h2></div></div>
		<div class="content-layout-area-inner">
		    I was about to finish work and was feeling a bit stressed, so I decided to text Samantha to see if she might be available to assist with some very needed stress relief. She responded immediately, and I was on my way following that. It took a few minutes to get through afternoon rush hour traffic, but it did not take long to get there.  When I arrived, she greeted me at the door of a nice quiet little apartment in the late afternoon.  She was wearing a cute little t-shirt with jeans.  She's a sweet and attractive young lady.  We hugged as soon as the door was shut behind us.  I excused myself to use her bathroom and freshen up a bit.  I then when to her bedroom where she was lying on the bed waiting for me.  We conversed for a bit, I think she was waiting on me to get undressed. Once I was completely undressed, I think she felt more comfortable and did the same. We continued to talk for a bit as she rolled over and asked what I liked. I told her I liked to touch, feel, and caress.  She rolled onto her tummy and let me rub her legs and backside. I did this for a little while and enjoyed the feeling of her skin at my fingertips and squeezing her tiny little backside. After a little wile of this she rolled to her back and scooted close to me as I laid on my side. She reached down and started petting the little fellow.  He responded slowly to her touches, but responded nonetheless.  As she played with him, she continued to move closer and before I knew it, she had him in her mouth. This felt very nice and I just enjoyed the sensation as I relaxed and continued to touch her body. Just as soon as he was hard enough, she grabbed a cover and placed it on and continued to stroke him.  She said, "I think he's good now".  With that she asked me how I would like her. I asked her what she liked best and she said she had no real preference. I suggested we start with missionary and finish with doggy style.  She agreed, and before I knew it, she had me lubed up and I was inside of her.  This felt wonderful, as I massaged her breasts and then moved so we were chest to chest which placed my lips near her ear which I started to nibble and kiss on her neck. I also moved around and kissed her lips as I went from one side to the other. At some point I also moved down to take each nipple into my mouth while I moved in and out of her very slowly. Eventually I sat back and started to massage her clit while I continued to move in and out of her cute little kitty. She had been making some very nice noised up to this point, but now there were definitely more. I later found out that she enjoys clit play and oral gratification. That might be something to explore the next time around. She then asked if I was ready for some doggy style. I agreed and we moved around to make this happen. She applied more lubrication and I entered her from behind. She stated that condoms dry her out. I've definitely heard and experienced that before. The view was very nice and once I was in a comfortable position, I increased my pace as I was sure I was closing in on the end of my time since I had only scheduled a short visit. I pounded away and worked it for all I had left in me, it wasn't long before I was getting close. I really enjoyed the view of her little booty bouncing around as I moved in and out of her quickly now. Soon I was filling the cover with days of frustration and built up stress attributed to work and life and in general. The sweet release felt wonderful. As we were getting cleaned up and dressed she let me know that we went for over half an hour and not just a short stay. I apologized and made it right by providing her with the amount for a half hour. Soon she was getting a call from her roommate and it was time for me to hit the road. I gave her a hug and thanked her. She is a sweet young lady, please be kind to her gentlemen. I hope you enjoy as well.
