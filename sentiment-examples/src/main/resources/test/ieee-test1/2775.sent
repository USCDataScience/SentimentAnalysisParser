This Test Procedure covers definition of terms, controlled test conditions, test apparatus, test methods, and data presentation, which form the basis for establishing performance criteria of mobile communication receivers designed to receive frequency-modulated waves in the frequency range from 25 to 1000 megahertz. Specific limits are not included; however, reference values that are not limited by the state of the art are provided. Test conditions, apparatus, and methods are based on known instrumentation and measuring techniques and are not restricted to any special apparatus other than necessary terminal simulators. Presentation of data has been standardized to the three forms of tabular, graphical, and empirical equations.
