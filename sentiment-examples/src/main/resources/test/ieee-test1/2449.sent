This IEEE Standards product is part of the C37 family on Switchgear, Substations and Protective Relays. The basic principles, requirements, and methods for qualifying Class 1E protective relays and auxiliaries, such as test and control switches, terminal blocks, and indicating lamps, for applications in nuclear power generating stations are described. The qualification procedure is generic in nature and can be used to demonstrate the design adequacy of such equipment under normal, abnormal, design-basis-event, and post-design-basis-event conditions. Protective relays and auxiliaries located inside primary containment areas in a nuclear power generating station are not covered.
