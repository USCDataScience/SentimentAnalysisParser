The performance of optical current and voltage measurement systems used in the generation, transmission, and distribution of alternating current electricity, and to assist in the proper selection of such equipment is described in this trial-use standard. This standard covers certain physical characteristics of the sensing systems that use optical techniques to measure current and voltage. This standard provides the requirements for the performance characteristics and the test of optical current and voltage sensors of a nominal system voltage of 1 kV and above, the information related to the nature of these sensors, and the information related to the application and use of these sensors.
