This amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2002 as amended by IEEE Std 802.3ae-2002, IEEEStd 802.3af-2003, IEEE Std 802.3aj-2003, and IEEE Std 802.3ak-2004 combines a minimal set ofextensions to the IEEE 802.3 Media Access Control (MAC) and MAC Control sublayers with afamily of Physical (PHY) Layers. These Physical Layers include optical fiber and voice grade coppercable Physical Medium Dependent sublayers (PMDs) for point-to-point connections in subscriberaccess networks. This amendment also introduces the concept of Ethernet Passive OpticalNetworks (EPONs), in which a point to multi-point (P2MP) network topology is implemented withpassive optical splitters, along with optical fiber PMDs that support this topology. In addition, amechanism for network Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) is included to facilitatenetwork operation and troubleshooting. To support these innovations, options for unidirectionaltransmission of frames are provided for 100BASE-X, 1000BASE-X, 10GBASE-R, 10GBASE-W,and 10GBASE-X.
