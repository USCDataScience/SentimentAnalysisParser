A uniform method is established for determining the temperature classification for the insulation systems for open-wound, solid-cast and resin-encapsulated power and distribution transformers by testing rather than by chemical composition. These insulation systems are intended for use in transformers covered by IEEE Std C57.12.01���� and IEEE Std C57.12.91���� as they apply to dry-type transformers whose highest voltages exceed nominal 600 V.
