Three-phase and single-phase AC synchronous and induction electric motors in ratings 0.18 kW (1/4 hp) and larger are covered in this guide. Primary emphasis is on the use of open or nonexplosionproof or nonflameproof enclosed motors in Class I, Division 2 and Class I, Zone 2 locations as covered in NFPA 70-2011. Surface temperature test methods and sine wave and non-sine wave applications are covered. Precautions against excessive surface temperatures and sparking are included. To mitigate hot surface temperatures and sparking, this document provides guidance for selecting, operating, and maintaining motors in Class I, Division 2 and Class I, Zone 2 locations. This guide does not cover AC wound rotor motors and DC electric motors. Motors installed in locations other than Class I, Division 2 and Class I, Zone 2 as covered in NFPA 70-2011 are not covered in this guide. This document is not a specification and is not intended to be used as a specification for purchasing motors. The voltage breaks in this document are 1000 V and less, and over 1000 V.
