This standard pertains to small low-power pulse transformers for use in electronic equipment, transmitting peak power of 300 W or less and average power of 5 W or less with a peak working voltage of 1000 V or less. These transformers are required to transform unipolar or bipolar pulses of voltage or current within specified tolerances of amplitude and time when operated between specified impedances. This standard is not intended to include low-power "switching" type pulse transformers which are covered in IEEE Std 272-1970, Standard for Computer-Type (SquareLoop) Pulse Transformers. These transformers depend upon the use of "square-loop" core material for operation, have "memory" capability, and normally transmit only bipolar pulses unless provision is made for core flux reset. This standard is not intended to include transformers for power conversion applications. Those transformers will be covered in a related standard. Whenever numerical values are indicated they may be considered as recommended values. Section 2 contains definitions of terms pertaining primarily to functional testing of low-power pulse transformers, and Section 5 contains equivalent circuits and definitions of associated terms. Section 6 describes preferred transformer test methods and the appendix contains alternate test methods.
