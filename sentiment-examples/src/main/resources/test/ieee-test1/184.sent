Guidance on the application of service management systems (SMS) based on the requirements in IEEE Std 20000-2-2013 (ISO/IEC 20000-1) is provided in this adoption of ISO/IEC 20000-2:2012. This standard enables organizations and individuals to interpret ISO/IEC 20000-1 more accurately and therefore to use it more effectively. The guidance includes examples and suggestions to enable organizations to interpret and apply ISO/IEC 20000-1, including references to other parts of ISO/IEC 20000 and other relevant standards. This includes guidance on the use of an SMS for the planning, design, transition, delivery and improvement of the SMS and services. At a minimum this includes service management policies, objectives, plans, service management processes, process interfaces, documentation, and resources. The SMS provides ongoing control, greater effectiveness, efficiency, and opportunities for continual improvement of service management and of services. It enables an organization to work effectively with a shared vision.
