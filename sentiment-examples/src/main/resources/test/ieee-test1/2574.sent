Currently, no defined, industry-accepted method exists for characterizing the performance of electrical circuit probes. Each vendor has its own proprietary methods for characterization, leaving probe customers and users without a valid means of comparing probe performance and/or of understanding the circuit-loading effect of the probe. Methods for measuring parameters indicative of a probes or probe systems performance and guidance on the design and use of a test fixture for measuring probe performance are provided by this standard. An industry-accepted, unbiased means for characterizing probe performance is given by these methods. High-impedance voltage probes that are used to measure the performance of electrical circuits are considered by this standard. The probe systems may include waveform acquisition hardware and software and signal/waveform analysis software. The probe will include the mechanism by which the circuit is contacted. This method and standard will be applicable toall individual probes having one signal conductor and one ground conductor or two signal conductors, and having an input impedance at least five times greater than the impedance of the circuit under test.
