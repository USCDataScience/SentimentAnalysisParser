Revision of IEEE Std 1512.1-2003 This standard addresses the exchange of vital data about public safety and emergency management issues involved in transportation-related events, through common incident management message sets. The message sets specified are consistent with the National Intelligent Transportation Systems Architecture and are described using Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1 or ASN) syntax. This standard comprises the basic volume of the family of incident management standards, a multi-volume set of documents centered around this Base Standard. Other members of that family include three other companion volumes, specifying incident management message sets for transportation-management-related data exchange and hazardous-material- and cargo-related data exchange, etc. Collectively, that family of standards shall be referred to as the 1512 Family of Standards. The goal of that family of standards is to support efficient communication for the real-time, interagency management of transportationrelated events. Those events include incidents, emergencies, accidents, planned roadway closures, special events, and disasters caused by humans or natural events. Those events include any such event that impacts transportation systems or that causes a report to be received by an emergency management system, whether or not the event actually affects a transportation system and whether or not a response is required.
