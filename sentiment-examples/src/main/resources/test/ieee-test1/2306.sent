An extensible IEEE 802(R) media access independent services framework (i.e., function and protocol) is defined that enables the optimization of services including handover and other services when performed between heterogeneous IEEE 802 networks. These services are facilitated by this standard when networking between IEEE 802 networks and cellular networks.
