A number of tests are presented for use in determining the significant parameters and performance characteristics of electronics transformers and inductors. These tests are designed primarily for transformers and inductors used in all types of electronics applications, but they may apply to the other types of transformers of large apparent-power rating used in the electric power utility industry.
