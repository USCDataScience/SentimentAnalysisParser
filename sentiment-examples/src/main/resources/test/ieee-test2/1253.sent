This Preprint provides the full text of each proposal to revise the 2007 Edition of the NESC together with the recommendation of the subcommittee that has cognizance of the rule addressed by the change proposal (CP). The deadline for receipt of comments on the Proposal Revision contained herein is 1 May 2010. All comments shall be submitted through the Web site shown below. Only comments that are submitted electronically through the Web site will be accepted. (http://standards.ieee.org/nesc/Iumldagger/welcome.html) Comments for each separate topic are to be uploaded separately using the template at the following URL: (http://standards.ieee. org/nesc/rp/Comment.doc). In those cases where a single CP or a group of related CPs affects rules within the scopes of two or more subcommittees, the recommendation of all subcommittees affected are included. Where the recommendation of two or more subcommittees are not compatible with each other, a recommendation by Subcommittee 1, which is responsible for coordination, is also included.

The subcommittee final recommendation will be prepared for a January 2011 letter ballot of the National Electrical Safety Code Committee.
