"AIEE American Standard for Rotating Electrical Machinery on Railway Locomotives and Rail Cars and Trolley, Gasoline -Electric and Oil- Electric Coaches",,,AIEE No. 11-1943,20151221,1943,,,1,20,"In undertaking the preparation of rules for standards for rotating electrical equipment for railway cars and locomotives under the Rules of Procedure of the American Standards Association, it has been necessary to cover a much wider field than was included in the AIEE Standards for Railway Motors which were published in 1925, approved as American Standards in 1928 and form the basis of this standard. In the first place, the scope of the rules has been changed to include all rotating electrical machinery forming a part of the power equipment of electrically-propelled railway cars and locomotives (including trolley, gasoline-electric and oil-electric coaches). In the second place, it has been found desirable to add new rules covering principally, rating, commutation, and over speed tests. In the third place, the old rules must be brought up-to-date as modern methods of ventilating electrical machinery have changed the situation in many respects. It is therefore felt necessary that some explanatory notes should be added to the rules in order to give the users of the rules a clearer understanding of the reasons for them.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1943.7361725,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7361725,,AIEE Standards;Electric machines;Machinery;Propulsion;Rail transportation;Rotation measurement;Velocity control,,,,,,,,,,March 12 1943,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

Scope: This document standardizes terminology and indexes for reporting electric generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity performance measures. A generating unit includes all equipment up to the high-voltage terminal of the generator step-up transformer. Reliability in this standard encompasses measures of the ability of generating units to perform their intended function. Availability measures are concerned with the fraction of time a unit is capable of providing service, and account for outage frequency and duration. Productivity measures are concerned with the total power produced by a plant with respect to its potential power production. Therefore, productivity measures consider magnitude of outage as well as frequency and duration of outage. NOTE This standard was developed for application at the unit level; the definitions are applicable below the unit level in most cases. There are some exceptions, however, such as the definition of in service, which applies only at the unit level. Because of these exceptions, care should be taken when using this standard below the unit level.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1987.81031,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=27828,,Generators;Reliability;Standards,electric generators;reliability;standards,IEEE standards;availability;electric generator performance data;electric power industry;indexes;productivity;reliability;terminology,,1,,,,,,May 20 1987,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

AIEE Application Guide for Grounding of Instrument Transformer Secondary Circuits and Cases,,,AIEE No 52-1951,20160308,1951,,,1,8,"It has been common practice for a long time in this country to ground the secondary circuits and cases of most instrument transformers used in switching stations, substations and generating stations and in certain other types of installations for reasons of safety to personnel and equipment. The object of the grounding is to limit the voltage on the secondary circuits and cases due to the effects of (1) possible insulation failure or other accidental contact between the primary circuit and the secondary circuit and/or case, which can subject them to full primary voltage, and (2) the capacitive coupling! between the primary and secondary circuit and case, which may impart to the secondary circuit and/or case objectionable or dangerous voltages to ground. However, there has been no general agreement among manufacturers and users whether all such instrument transformers, including auxiliary transformers, irrespective of voltage, should be grounded or just how this grounding should be done. The object of this Guide, based to a large extent on the findings and conclusions contained in a report by the AIEE Relay Committee titled Grounding of Instrument Transformer Secondary Circuits'' published in the April 1947 issue of Electrical Engineering, is to give recommendations in this respect.This Guide contains general and specific recommendations for grounding of the secondary circuits and cases of instrument, i.e., potential and current, transformers in all types of installations. These recommendations apply to all instrument transformers irre-spective of the value of primary voltage or whether the primary windings of the transformers are connected to, or in, power circuits or whether these primary windings are connected in the secondary circuits of other instrument transformers. Exceptions to grounding are permissible where the advantages obtained by not grounding in certain instances or in certain types of installations are considered to outweigh the safety or other adv- ntages obtained by grounding. However, such exceptions should be made only (1) when the instrument transformers form part of a separate metering or network installation and not part of a switching station, substation or generating station, and (2) when the primary windings are connected to circuits of 600 volts or less. Furthermore, for reasons of increased safety in those metering or network installations where the instrument transformers or live parts of the secondary circuit are accessible to other than authorized personnel, (1) the exceptions to the grounding of the secondary circuits should be made only if the voltage of the primary circuit is 300 volts or less to ground and (2) the exceptions to the grounding of the cases should be made only if the voltage of the primary circuit is 150 volts or less to ground.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1951.7428789,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7428789,,AIEE Standards;Grounding;Instrumentation;Power transformers;Secondary circuits;Transformers,instrument transformers;standards;substations,generating station;generating stations;instrument transformer secondary circuit grounding;network installation;network installations;primary windings;substations;switching station;switching stations,,,,,,,,March 8 1951,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

AIEE Guide for Evaluating the Effect of Solar Radiation on Outdoor Metal-Clad Switchgear,,,AIEE No 955-1962,20160325,1962,,,1,18,"Over the past several years, outdoor metal-clad switchgear has reached a position of widespread application comparable to that of indoor gear. Its satisfactory record for many years in cold, temperate, and hot climates has contributed to this increased usage. However, there are conditions affecting its application which are different from those for indoor gear and warrant special consideration.This was realized and a study of the situation was undertaken by the AIEE Switchgear Assemblies Subcommittee. It was first determined that temperature data were not available on fully loaded units in the field. Outdoor laboratory and field testing was then tried, and it became evident, due to uncontrollable conditions, that accurate and complete data suitable for establishing the current-carrying capability of outdoor metal-clad switchgear could not be obtained. Next, indoor testing simulating outdoor conditions was resorted to. Further valuable data were accumulated, but there is still no absolute relationship between results obtained indoors and conditions existing outdoors. However, based on these investigations, sufficient data are now available for the preparation of a Guide for using outdoor metal-clad switchgear in various climates.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1962.7442039,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442039,,AIEE Standards;Heating;Metals;Outdoor communication;Performance evaluation;Solar energy;Solar radiation;Switchgear,atmospheric radiation;switchgear,AIEE Std 955 5-1962;AIEE switchgear assembly;cold climate;current-carrying capability;hot climate;indoor gear;indoor testing simulation;outdoor metal-clad switchgear;solar radiation effect evaluation;warrant special consideration,,,,,,,,May 31 1962,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

The values given are not mandatory, but are recommended for use in preference to other values unless there are good technical or economic reasons for using others. The values recommended have in general been selected to agree with well established practices particularly in the power and industry fields. Provisions are made for a great variety of conditions and for widely different apparatus and materials, some of which may be of practical importance only under unusual circumstances. In an individual standard, only those quantities of real practical importance in the particular case should be used.

The values recommended have in general been selected to agree with well-established practices. Provisions are made for a great variety of conditions and for widely different apparatus and materials, some of which may be of practical importance only under unusual circumstances. In any individual standard, only those quantities of real practical importance in the particular case should be used. When ranges are suggested, it is generally with the thought that acceptance tests may be made within that range.

The trend toward generating units of larger capacity has dictated the need for higher rated isolated-phase bus designs. The increased losses associated with the higher capacity bus may be significant in the economic evaluation of alternate schemes or selection of equipment. The bus designer must know the magnitude and distribution of losses in order to keep temperature rises of bus components within the limits specified in USA Standard C37.20. In addition, the losses must be known to permit proper sizing of forced-cooling equipment whenever it is used.Various papers have been presented that deal with the determination of losses in isolated-phase bus enclosures. The difference in the results obtained for the same bus using various methods is of sufficient magnitude to cause concern.

Protective relaying has met this challenge by providing more sensitive, higher speed relay systems that are inherently reliable. Among the more significant protective developments that furthered the economic design of power systems are pilot, relaying schemes and direct, transfer tripping over telephone channels.In recent years a growing need developed for more versatile wire-pilot relay systems and more secure means for direct transfer tripping. These factors, in addition to technological changes in telephone communication plants affecting availability of metallic, telephone circuits, led to the consideration of audio-tone signals over telephone channels for these functions.

IEEE Guide for Protective Relaying of Utility-Consumer Interconnections,,,IEEE Std 357-1973 (ANSI C37.95-1974),20160218,1973,,,1,44,"The physical means by which electric energy is received from the electric utility is known as an electric interconnection. The primary elements include transmission or distribution circuits, transformers, and switching devices in the form of circuit breakers, fuses, and isolating disconnecting switches. The secondary elements include sensing devices to obtain information to operate the primary equipment intelligently, and relays to initiate removal of equipment from service automatically and quickly when an electric fault or disturbance occurs. It is important to remember that the physical laws of nature which govern the operating behavior of an electric system do not recognize defined lines of electric facility ownership. Thus for a well-engineered interconnection it is mandatory that problems in electric-system protection be studied and analyzed critically without regard to ownership. From the viewpoint of service reliability and service continuity, it is basic to understand that the best conceived, best implemented relaying system is no substitute for an adequately designed power system; and, indeed, inadequately applied protective relaying will contribute to inadequate and unsatisfactory performance of an otherwise well-designed electric system. In considering a new installation, or changes to an existing arrangement, it is very important that protective relaying and safety be given careful attention in the early stages of planning.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1973.7409858,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7409858,,ANSI Standards;Conductivity;Current measurement;IEEE Standards;Protective relaying;Temperature measurement;Voltage measurement,IEEE standards;power system faults;power system interconnection;power system protection;power system relaying,IEEE Std 357-1973;IEEE guide;circuit breakers;disconnecting switches;distribution circuits;electric disturbance;electric energy;electric fault;electric interconnection;electric utility;electric-system protection;fuses;protective relaying;relaying system;switching devices;transformers;transmission circuits;utility-consumer interconnections,,,,,,,,May 24 1973,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

In converters using circuit-commutated thyristors, the commutating voltages required to transfer current from one branch to another are normally supplied by capacitors. The type of power conversion may be DC to AC, DC to DC, AC to DC, or AC to AC. Converters in which commutating voltages are supplied by the AC lines, the AC load, or some other AC source outside the converter, are excluded from the scope of this guide except where they may be linked with a self-commutated converter.<<ETX>>",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1987.81536,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=29053,,Power conversion;Standards;Thyristor applications,commutation;power convertors;standards;thyristor applications,capacitors;circuit-commutated thyristors;gate turn-off thyristors;power conversion;self-commutated power converters;switching devices;transistors,,0,,4,,,,1987,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

Major issues recognized include: (1) Outcome of the test and failure criteria: upset or damage? (2) Type of tests: design tests involve pushing stresses to the limits while production tests are more likely to be pass/fail types. Diagnostic tests involve reproduction of field failures in the laboratory. (3) Appropriate selection of a voltage wave or of a current wave, or both, depending on the nature of the test piece and on the expected pass/fail criteria. (4) Implementation of the test.

For this reason, the procedures set forth here are designed to determine the characteristics of a given rotor and stator under a standardized set of ambient conditions. Because of the wide variety of environmental conditions possible within a compressor, no attempt is made to simulate such operation.

Todays intensely competitive business environment forces plant and building management to be very aware of the total owning cost of power distribution systems. Furthermore, these managers demand assurance of maximum return on capital investments in the power system. Power system studies are used to ensure that this maximum return is achieved, and the IEEE Brown Book is a valuable source of information about the purposes of, and techniques involved in, power system studies. The IEEE Brown Book ties together the essential fundamentals of power system studies; the most common studies for design or operation of a power system; and basic computational methods, including key information on the various types of computer systems and their requirements. By combining field experience in power system engineering with computer systems, engineers can perform detailed studies on both existing and proposed power systems. The planning, design, and operation of industrial and commercial power systems require several studies to assist in the evaluation of initial and future system performance, system reliability, safety, and the ability to grow with production and/or operating requirements. The power system analyses discussed in the IEEE Brown Book can help answer many questions about an existing system, such as the impact of expansion, the stability of the system, and the load distribution of the system. Chapters are devoted to different types of studies, and also include guidance on the preparation for these studies. Some of the studies discussed are: load flow studies, short-circuit studies, stability studies, motor starting studies, harmonic analysis studies, switching transient studies, reliability studies, cable ampacity studies, ground mat studies, coordination studies, and dc auxiliary power system analyses.

These include in vivo, sub-cellular medical communication, smart materials and sensing at the molecular level, and the ability to operate in environments that would be too harsh for macroscale communication mechanisms to operate. Collaboration among a highly diverse set of disciplines with differing definitions and connotations for some terms is required by nanoscale communication, thus a common terminology is necessary in order to aid inter-discipline collaboration. A common framework for thinking abstractly about nanoscale communication can aid in defining and relating research and development effort. Components of the framework are independent enough to allow them to be developed in relative isolation, yet the components are also interoperable. To illustrate the recommended practice, example mappings between specific nanoscale communication use-cases and the common framework are included.

System protection and coordination serve to minimize damage to a system and its components, thereby limiting the extent and duration of any service interruption occurring on any portion of the system. The IEEE Buff Book deals with the proper selection, application, and coordination of the components that constitute system protection for industrial plants and commercial buildings. The IEEE Buff Book presents complete information on protection and coordination principles designed to protect industrial and commercial power systems against any abnormalities that could reasonably be expected to occur during the course of system operation. The information is arranged in a convenient step-by-step format for easy comprehension. It is a valuable sourcebook for use at the system design stage, as well as in the modification of existing operations for better system protection. The IEEE Buff Book supports the goal of system protection by efficiently isolating and removing problems. In achieving this goal, certain design features must be utilized. One of the main design features involves the rapid isolation of the affected portion of the system, while maintaining normal operation elsewhere. Another design feature reduces the short-circuit current to minimize damage to the system, its components, and the utilization equipment it supplies. Yet another design feature provides alternate circuits, automatic throwovers, and automatic reclosing devices. These design features for system protection are the focus of the IEEE Buff Book.

IEEE Recommended Practice for Speech Quality Measurements,,,IEEE No 297-1969,20160211,1969,,,1,24,"The increasing variety of speech transmission systems has created a new problem for communication engineers. This problem consists of the subjective evaluation of the speech quality produced by these systems. For investigators interested only in the utilization of some procedure applicable to this problem, it was difficult to make a choice among the wide range of documented approaches. The IEEE Audio and Electroacoustics Group therefore formed a Subcommittee on Subjective Measurements, which has been charged with writing a Recommended Practice for speech quality measurement. The intent of the Subcommittee became to write a document that would facilitate the choice of method by reducing the variety of procedures to several which had been successful and looked promising for the future, and which could handle a variety of signals. By describing these methods in some detail, it would be possible for different laboratories to obtain comparable results and thus aid in the exchange of information. Because of the relatively early stage of the development of speech quality evaluation, the present document is intended to be a Recommended Practice, but not a long term standard, which would require speech quality measurement only according to the proposed methods. It is hoped that the document will generate additional investigation into problems of this type of measurement, and allow comparison of test data obtained in different laboratories. Thus, a body of experimental data may be generated that will be useful to future investigations as well as the improvement of the present practices. The Subcommittee expects that feedback from users of the practices will allow the revision and updating of the practices within a relatively short time period. It should be pointed out that the present practices evaluate only speech signals as they are generated by one-way speech communication systems. Systems, especially two-way systems, in which interactive communication takes place, cannot- validly be evaluated by these methods. One of the directions, therefore, in which these practices might be updated in the future is by adding material on the evaluation of communications systems. It is the hope of the Subcommittee that the present document will be helpful in some way to people confronted with the task of making speech quality measurements. In order to guide its future work, the Subcommittee would appreciate that any technical comments about the usefulness of the documents, or any other comments or information about speech quality measurement, be sent to its Chairman, c/o the IEEE Audio and Electroacoustics Group, IEEE Headquarters.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1969.7405210,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7405210,,IEEE Standards;Quality of service;Speech processing,IEEE standards;speech processing,IEEE Audio and Electroacoustics Group;IEEE No. 297;Subcommittee on Subjective Measurements;interactive communication;one-way speech communication systems;recommended practice;speech quality evaluation;speech quality measurement;speech signals;speech transmission systems;technical comments,,,,,,,,June 11 1969,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

In the time domain document, bursts are defined and particular attention is placed on their duration and magnitude. The use of additional characteristics may prove desirable when investigating both cause and effect of a burst. Mathematical transformations have been widely used to bring out particular characteristics of signals. Perhaps the one most commonly used is the Fourier Transform, which defines the spectrum of signals. The energy density spectrum of a burst, a quantity derived from the Fourier Transform, is the subject of this report. Other transformations such as those of Hilbert or Henkel, may be used to display different characteristics of a burst but they will not be considered here. Sampling the energy density spectrum is the key concept of this document. It constitutes the basis by which this spectrum can be characterized comprehensively by a practical number of measurements.

IEEE Recommended Practices for Burst Measurements in the Frequency Domain,,,IEEE No 265-1966,20160126,1966,,,1,20,"This document is a companion to Technical Committee Report on Recommended Practices for Burst Measurements in the Time Domain, IEEE No. 257, May 1964. In the time domain document, bursts are defined and particular attention is placed on their duration and magnitude.The use of additional characteristics may prove desirable when investigating both cause and effect of a burst. Mathematical transformations have been widely used to bring out particular characteristics of signals. Perhaps the one most commonly used is the Fourier Transform, which defines the spectrum of signals. The energy density spectrum of a burst, a quantity derived from the Fourier Transform, is the subject of this report. Other transformations such as those of Hilbert or Hankel, may be used to display different characteristics of a burst but they will not be considered here. Sampling the energy density spectrum is the key concept of this document. It constitutes the basis by which this spectrum can be characterized comprehensively by a practical number of measurements. The sampling theorems in the frequency domain are, therefore, given detailed consideration in Appendices to the extent necessary for understanding the measurement methods to be discussed.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1966.7393399,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393399,,Burst switching;Frequency-domain analysis;IEEE Standards,,,,,,,,,,Feb. 26 1966,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

The corona-free voltage is specified to be 1.10 times the line-to-neutral voltage equivalent of rated maximum voltage. Only visible corona are defined because this satisfies the majority of user requirements. Actual tests performed show satisfactory radio influence voltage (RIV) levels after the extinction of visible corona over the external extremities of the device. In the past, switches determined to be corona-free by the human eye accustomed to a darkened area, have not been a source of radio or television interference. The standards, however, allow an alternate photographic corona test method where necessary. Tests require switches to be free of visible corona at the corona extinction voltage because this voltage is lower than corona starting voltage.<<ETX>>",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1978.82355,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=30625,,Corona;Standards;Switchgear,corona;standards;switchgear,air switches;corona;corona extinction voltage;corona-free voltage;line-to-neutral voltage equivalent;photographic corona test method;radio influence voltage;visible corona,,0,,,,,,1978,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

The per-unit system thereby makes possible an easy comparison between different machines, essentially independent of size, without the use of conversion factors, and facilitates the identification of gross calculation errors. The proper selection of base values is fundamental to the usefulness of a per-unit system. Although per-unit quantities have been used for many years by designers of rotating machinery, the base quantities were not standardized, and it was necessary to define them in each publication. A working group of the Rotating Machinery Committee was created to propose a set of standard definitions. In 1961, a proposed standard (AIEE No. 86) was published for trial use.

When applied to electron beam devices and devices employing distributed nonlinear media, the variable parameter is equivalent to a reactance in the sense that it is associated with energy storage rather than eiiergy dissipative properties of the beam or medium. The qualifier, reactance, is more frequently applied to circuits in which the variable element is an easily identified lumped reactance. The qualifier, parametric, is more frequently applied to electron beam and distributed parameter devices, but can include the variable reactance devices as well.

In general, the definitions assume that the antenna is not located in a medium such as a plasma, salt water, or the earth. In such cases, careful evaluation may be necessary to determine whether the term is applicable and how it can be properly employed. For terms that are quantitative it is understood that frequency must be specified. Those terms in which phase or polarization is a significant part of the definition imply a coherent source of power.

Several possible methods exist for measuring tape flux, but the measurement given here involves only the use of a calibrated ring-core head which is described in the reference of the standard. Note that the present standard measurement is only for ""medium wavelengths"". A further standard method for measuring short-circuit flux at long wavelengths and at short wavelengths - that is, the ""frequency response"" of the flux on a magnetic record - is under consideration. The technique utilizing a calibrated ring-core head to measure directly the flux at medium wavelengths is superior to magnetometer methods and to ""single turn head"" methods which have been used in the past because the head is easily manufactured using highly perfected commercial methods. The transducer (head) is commercially available to any laboratory at a reasonable cost; it is easily used, and requires no specialized auxiliary equipment. A further advantage of this method over magnetometer methods is the elimination of the errors inherent in making the ""transfer"" recording which is necessary for a magnetometer measurement. This standard represents the joint efforts of the Recording and Reproducing Standards Subcommittee of the Standards Committee of IEEE Group on Audio and Electroacoustics and the Sound Engineering Committee of the Society of Motion Picture and Television En- ineers. It was originally prepared by an SMPTE Ad Hoc Committee as a method of measurement of flux on magnetic sound tracks used in motion-picture films, and was later modified for measurement of recorded flux in any form of magnetic sound record at medium wavelengths. This standard specifies a method of measuring the recorded flux per unit width of a magnetically recorded test signal at medium wavelengths for all magnetic sound record formats. It also specifies the equipment needed to implement this method.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1972.7409897,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7409897,,ANSI Standards;Calibration;Frequency measurement;IEEE Standards;Magnetic flux;Magnetic head;Voltage measurement;Wavelength measurement,IEEE standards;audio recording;magnetic flux;magnetic recording;magnetic tapes;magnetic variables measurement;magnetometers,IEEE Group on Audio and Electroacoustics;IEEE Std 347-1972;IEEE standard method;Recording and Reproducing Standards Subcommittee;Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers;Sound Engineering Committee;audio programs;magnetic sound record formats;magnetic sound records;magnetometer measurement;medium wavelengths;recorded flux measurement;reproducing head sensitivity;tape flux measurement;transducer head,,,,,,,,Oct. 25 1972,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

IEEE Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments,,,IEEE Std 200-1975,20080403,1975,,,1,28,"This revision added paragraphs on repeated circuits, selected and matched parts, and designation of deposited components on hybrid printed circuits. An appendix B was added covering the Item Designation system of IEC Publication 113-2. Supplement A of 1970 was incorporated into the text, along with minor clarifications and updating of references. Significant changes are marked by vertical black bars in the margin, adjacent to the changed text. The 1968 revision and its 1970 Supplement coordinated the title with the terms used in related standards, added the class letter U, identified names approved in the Federal Item Identification Guide (H6-1), and transferred the class letter list to IEEE Std 315 (ANSI Y32.2). The original issue of this standard was prepared by Subcommittee 16 on Reference Designations, appointed by Sectional Committee Y32 on Graphic Symbols and Designations for the purpose of preparing standard reference designations in the field of electrical and electronic equipment. Early work on reference designations, of the type herein standardized as the Unit Numbering Method, was done by the Symbols Committee of the Institute of Radio Engineers and was published in 1949 as Standards on Designations for Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Parts and their Symbols, 49 IRE 21.SI. In 1951 the U.S. Department of Defense issued MIL-STD-16 which closely resembled the IRE Standard and acknowledged the pioneering work of the IRE Symbols Committee in this field. In order to minimize confusion, intensive and successful efforts have since been made to coordinate the two standards throughout their subsequent revisions. The work on this standard was greatly facilitated by the constant participation of representatives of the Department of Defense and the IEEE Symbols Committee. As in MIL-SfD-16C, the original Block Numbering Method of assigning reference designations has been deleted in favor of the more flexible and universally applicable Unit Numbering Method, whic- is retained, with minor modifications, in Section 4 of this standard. The explanation of the Block Numbering Method appearing as Appendix A does not form a part of this standard, but is retained for reference in connection with existing equipment on which it was used. The subcommittee was assigned the task of standardizing means for physically locating, through a form of reference designation, the parts and divisions of an equipment. The Location Numbering Method in Section 5 and the Location Coding Method in Section 6 of this standard are based on existing industry practices which have been successfully used to facilitate manufacture and service of complex apparatus by providing such locating means. They are especially useful in designs making multiple use of identical or closely similar parts of subassemblies.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1975.4483758,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483758,Symbols;designations;equipment;parts;reference,,ANSI standards;IEEE standards;printed circuits,ANSI Y32.16-1975;ANSI standard;IEEE Std 200-1975;IEEE standard;block numbering method;electrical equipment;electrical parts;electronics equipment;electronics parts;hybrid printed circuits;location coding method;location numbering method;reference designations;subassemblies;unit numbering method,,0,,,,,,Dec. 30 1975,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

IEEE Standard Technical Specifications of a DC Quick Charger for Use with Electric Vehicles,,,IEEE Std 2030.1.1-2015,20160205,2016,,,1,97,"Direct-current (dc) charging is a method of charging that facilitates rapid energy transfer from the electric grid to plug-in vehicles. This method of charging allows significantly more current to be drawn by the vehicle versus lower rated alternating-current (ac) systems. A combination of vehicles that can accept high-current dc charge and the dc supply equipment that provides it has led to the use of terminology such as fast charging, fast charger, dc charger, quick charger, etc. DC charging and ac charging vary by the location at which ac current is converted to dc current. For typical dc charging, the current is converted at the off-board charger, which is separate from the vehicle. For ac charging, the current is converted inside the vehicle, by means of an on-board charger. The location of the ac to dc conversion equipment, or converter, shapes the complexity of the equipment design. Regarding ac charging, as previously mentioned, the conversion is on boardthe vehicle. This allows the original equipment maker (OEM) designed systems to control the charging operation in its entirety. The on-board charger (converter) and battery controller solutionis under direct control of the vehicle manufacturer. For dc charging, an entirely new challenge exists for OEMs. The dc charger is now external to the vehicle and requires the vehicle engineers to control an external power device.

IEEE Standard Test Procedure for Measuring Longitudinal Balance of Telephone Equipment Operating in the Voice Band,,,ANSI/IEEE Std 455-1976,20160301,1976,,,1,16,"Telephone companies and equipment manufacturers have generally agreed on a definition for longitudinal balance for many years. This agreement extends also to the basic approach followed when measuring balance. Testing a device for balance involves the application of a longitudinal voltage. Then any resulting metallic voltage is measured, and the ratio of the two voltages is used to develop a balance number.Unfortunately, agreement has ended at about this point. A number of different test circuits are used by different segments of the telephone industry. Although all of the existing test circuits have some merits supporting their use, the mere existence of varied circuits leads to differences in test results.In addition to differences related to the test set, test conditions and procedures can also affect the result. When an item of equipment is to be tested, there is often a test set or procedure,or both, capable of giving any desired result.Agreement on one way of testing for longitudinal balance has been sought. This standard represents such agreement. It defines the basic requirements of a standard test circuit. Reasonable tolerances are included so that a test-set designer will find considerable latitude to make the set his own way. Besides defining the requirements for a test circuit, this standard includes test conditions and procedures that must be established and followed. As a result, all test sets designed and used in accordance with the standard will produce the same balance number for a given test specimen. Similarly, comparing balance numbers for different devices will become more meaningful when all come from tests meeting the standard.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1976.7422618,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422618,,Attenuation measurement;IEEE Standards;Longitudinal balance;Speech processing;Telehone equipment,ANSI standards;IEEE standards;balances;circuit testing;telephone equipment;voltage measurement,ANSI-IEEE 455-1976 standard;IEEE standard test procedure;circuit testing;equipment manufacturer;longitudinal balance measurement;metallic voltage measurement;telephone company;telephone equipment;telephone industry;voice band,,,,,,,,Sept. 30 1976,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

It supersedes ANSI/IEEE Std 301-1976, IEEE Standard Test Procedures for Amplifiers and Preamplifiers for Semiconductor Radiation detectors for Ionizing Radiation. The title was changed because the same amplifiers used for semiconductor detectors are applicable to other types. In this standard, measuring procedures are given in greater detail because with modern amplifiers, perceived performance often depends on the details of measurement. Tests that are specific to amplifiers with time-variant pulse-shaping filters are not included, nor are tests for pile-up rejectors. Time-variant filters allow shorter pulse-shaping times than linear filters for the same signal-to-noise ratio, and pile-up rejectors block pulses that overlap earlier ones, allowing higher count rates for a given spectral-line resolution. Both techniques have the greatest application at very low energies because wide pulses must be used to optimize the SNR, and at high energies where detector artifacts cause low-side tailing of spectrum lines. The pulse width at 50% of peak amplitude is the main amplifier indicator of shaping time because this parameter best allows a performance comparison among different amplifiers. Compared with other parameters, this one is the easiest to measure accurately with an oscilloscope and pulse generator.<<ETX>>",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1989.101065,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=159348,,Electronic equipment testing;Proportional counters;Pulse amplifiers;Radiation detectors;Scintillation detectors;Semiconductor radiation detectors;Standards,electronic equipment testing;preamplifiers;proportional counters;pulse amplifiers;radiation detection and measurement;scintillation counters;semiconductor counters;standards,IEEE Standard;amplifiers;measuring procedures;performance comparison;pile-up rejectors;preamplifiers;proportional detectors;scintillation detectors;semiconductor detectors;test procedures,,2,1,3,,,,1989,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

Although this is obvious when stated, today's set of high-level design languages have not had a consistent way to concisely represent the regions of a design with different power provisions, nor the states of those regions or domains. This standard provides an HDL-independent way of annotating a design with power intent. In addition, the level-shifting and isolation between power domains may be described for a specific implementation, from high-level constraints to particular configurations. When the logic in a power domain receives different power supply levels, the logic state of portions of the design may be preserved with various state-retention strategies. This standard provides mechanisms for the refined and specific description of intent, effect, and implementation of various retention strategies. Incorporating components into designs is greatly assisted by the encapsulation and specification of the characteristics of the power environment of the design and the power requirements and capabilities of the components; this information encapsulation mechanism is also described in this standard.

The lack of uniform national interconnection standards and tests for interconnection operation and certification, as well as the lack of uniform national building, electrical, and safety codes, are understood. IEEE Std 1547 and its development demonstrate a model for ongoing success in establishing additional interconnection agreements, rules, and standards, on a national, regional, and state level. IEEE Std 1547 has the potential to be used in federal legislation and rule making and state public utilities commission (PUC) deliberations, and by over 3000 utilities in formulating technical requirements for interconnection agreements for distributed generators powering the electric grid. This standard focuses on the technical specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection itself. It provides requirements relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance of the interconnection. It includes general requirements, response to abnormal conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests. The stated requirements are universally needed for interconnection of distributed resources (DR), including synchronous machines, induction machines, or power inverters/converters and will be sufficient for most installations.",,Electronic:978-0-7381-3721-6,10.1109/IEEESTD.2003.94285,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225051,certification codes commissioning;dc injection design;federal;field;installation;national;networks;power resources electric distribution systems dispersed generation;production tests communications diesel generators distributed generation;quality photovoltaic power systems point of common coupling public utility commissions reclosing coordination regulations rule making;regional;state standards synchronous machines testing utilities wind energy systems;storage energy storage faults flicker fuel cells generators grid harmonics IEEE induction machines inverters interconnection requirements and specifications islanding microturbines monitoring and control paralleling power converters,,,,,52,31,6,,,,July 28 2003,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

IEEE Standard for Low-Voltage Differential Signals (LVDS) for Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI),,,IEEE Std 1596.3-1996,20020806,1996,,,i,,"The Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI), specified in IEEE Std 1596-1992, provides computer-bus-like services but uses a collection of fast point-to-point links instead of a physical bus in order to reach far higher speeds. The base specification defines differential ECL signals, which provide a high transfer rate (16 bits are transferred every 2 ns), but are inconvenient for some applications. IEEE Std 1596.3-1996, an extension to IEEE Std 1596-1992, defines a lower-voltage differential signal (as low as 250 mV swing) that is compatible with low-voltage CMOS, BiCMOS and GaAs circuitry. The power dissipation of the transceivers is low, since only 2.5 mA is needed to generate this differential voltage across a 100 /spl Omega/ termination resistance. Signal encoding is defined that allows transfer of SCI packets over data paths that are 4-, 8-, 32-, 64- and 128-bits wide. Narrow data paths (4 to 8 bits) transferring data every 2 ns can provide sufficient bandwidth for many applications while reducing the physical size and cost of the interface. The wider paths may be needed for very-high-performance systems.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1996.81028,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=503756,,Data buses,system buses,100 ohm;2.5 mA;250 mV;8 Gbit/s;BiCMOS;CMOS;GaAs circuitry;IEEE standard;SCI packet transfer;Scalable Coherent Interface;bandwidth;computer-bus-like services;data paths;differential ECL signals;differential voltage;fast point-to-point links;interface cost;interface size;low-voltage differential signals;power dissipation;signal encoding;termination resistance;transceivers;transfer rate,,6,64,1,,,,1996,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

Class TO provides the behavior specified by 1149.1 from startup when there are multiple on-chip TAPs. Class T1 adds common debug functions and features to minimize power consumption. Class T2 adds operating modes that maximize scan performance. It also provides an optional hot-connection capability to prevent system corruption when a connection is made to a powered system. Class T3 supports operation in either a fourwire series or star scan topology. Class T4 provides for communication with either a two-pin or four-pin interface. The two-pin operation serializes 1149.1 transactions and provides for higher test clock rates. Class T5 adds the ability to perform data transfers concurrent with scan, supports utilization of functions other than scan, and provides control of TAP.7 pins to custom debug technologies in a manner that ensures current and future interoperability.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.2010.5412866,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5412866,1149.1;1149.7;1149.7-2009;2-pin;2-wire;4-pin;4-wire;APU;Advanced Protocol;Advanced Protocol Unit;BDX;BSDL;BSDL.1;BSDL.7;BYPASS;Background Data Transfer;CDX;CID;CLTAPC;CP;Capture-IR;Chip-Level TAP Controller;Class T0;Class T1;Class T2;Class T3;Class T4;Class T5;Controller ID;Controller Identification Number;Custom Data Transfer;DOT1;DOT7;DTI;DTS;DTT;Data Register;Debug Test System;EOT;EPU;EXTEST;Escape;Extended Protocol;HSDL;HSDL.7;IDCODE;Instruction Register;JScan;JScan0;JScan1;JScan2;JScan3;JTAG;MScan;MTCP;Multi-TAP Control Path;OScan;OScan0;OScan1;OScan2;OScan3;OScan4;OScan5;OScan6;OScan7;PC0;PC1;Pause-DR;Pause-IR;RSU;RTI;Reset and selection unit;Run-Test/Idle;SP;SSD;SScan;SScan0;SScan1;SScan2;SScan3;STL;Scan Packet;Scan Selection Directive;Scan Topology;Series Branch;Series Scan;Series Scan Topology;Series Topology;Series-Equivalent Scan;Shift-DR;Shift-IR;SiP;Standard Protocol;Star Scan;Star Scan Topology;Star Topology;Star-2;Star-2 Branch;Star-2 Scan;Star-4;Star-4 Branch;Star-4 Scan;Star-4 Scan Topology;System Test Logic;T0;T0 TAP.7;T1;T1 TAP.7;T2;T2 TAP.7;T3;T3 TAP.7;T4;T4 TAP.7;T4(N);T4(N) TAP.7;T4(W);T4(W) TAP.7;T5;T5 TAP.7;T5(N);T5(N) TAP.7;T5(W);T5(W) TAP.7;TAP;TAP controller;TAP controller address;TAP selection;TAP.1;TAP.7;TAPC;TCA;TCKC;TDI;TDIC;TDOC;TDOE;TLR;TMSC;TP;Test Access Port;Test-Logic-Reset;Transport Packet;Update-DR;Update-IR;ZBS;background data transport;boundary scan;compact JTAG;compliant behavior;compliant operation;control level;controller address;custom data transport;debug and test interface;debug interface;debug logic;debug test target;extended operation;nTRST;nTRST_PD;narrow Star Scan Topology;optimized scan;scan;scan DR;scan IR;scan format;scan path;scan performance;scan protocol;scan topology;series;stall;star scan;test and debug;zero bit scan,Boundary conditions;IEEE standards;Testing,IEEE standards;boundary scan testing;integrated circuit testing;topology,IEEE 1149.1-2001;IEEE standard;boundary-scan architecture;enhanced-functionality test access port;integrated circuit;onchip test access ports;reduced-pin test access port;star scan topology;test clock rates,,2,12,1,,,,Feb. 10 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 specifies minimum requirements for the structure and contents of an assurance case to improve the consistency and comparability of assurance cases and to facilitate stakeholder communications, engineering decisions, and other uses of assurance cases. An assurance case includes a top-level claim for a property of a system or product (or set of claims), systematic argumentation regarding this claim, and the evidence and explicit assumptions that underlie this argumentation. Arguing through multiple levels of subordinate claims, this structured argumentation connects the top-level claim to the evidence and assumptions. Assurance cases are generally developed to support claims in areas such as safety, reliability, maintainability, human factors, operability, and security, although these assurance cases are often called by more specific names, e.g. safety case or reliability and maintainability (R&M) case. ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 does not place requirements on the quality of the contents of an assurance case and does not require the use of a particular terminology or graphical representation.

Ideally, the velocities of the scanning apertures should be uniform in both the horizontal and vertical directions; furthermore, these two directions of motion should be orthogonal at all points in the raster. Finally, the ratio of the maximum excursions of the apertures in the horizontal and vertical directions of the transmitted picture, i.e., the aspect ratio, should be the same at both the transmitter and receiver. If there is departure from any of these conditions, geometric distortion results (except in the trivial case where the transmitter and receiver happen to contain compensating errors). It should also be noted that even in the case where the scanning aperture itself meets the desired conditions, the optical systems may contribute to the total geometric distortion; this applies to either the transmitter or receiver.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1954.7370736,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7370736,,Broadcasting;Distortion;Geometric distortion;IEEE Standards;Measurement;TV,IEEE standards;cameras;image motion analysis;television receivers;television transmitters,IEEE Std 202-1954;IEEE standard;aspect ratio measurement method;camera image motion;geometric distortion measurement method;one-dimensional time function;picture transmission;scanning process agency;television receiver;television transmitter;two-dimensional space function,,,,,,,,Jan. 12 1954,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

Such bursts which interfere with desired signals are properly classified as noise. In the transmission of information, for example, signals which have low redundancy are highly vulnerable to burst interference. In acoustics, audible sound of the impulsive type is an increasingly important problem because of the annoyance it may cause; moreover, high-intensity solid-borne energy of an impulsive character sometimes produces structural failures. While quantities of relatively short time duration are of widespread interest, little is known about the statistics of these quantities insofar as peak amplitudes, repetition rates and wave shapes are concerned. In view of the increasingly important role played by energy bursts in modern technology, accepted procedures for identifying and characterizing burst-like events should be established. Obviously, no single method of measurement will satisfy all requirements equally well. The techniques described here are based on a set of definitions which have been chosen to be easily adaptable to many engineering applications.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1964.7385412,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7385412,,Burst switching;IEEE Standards;Measurements;Time domain analysis,energy measurement;time-domain analysis,IEEE Technical Committee Report;high-intensity solid-borne energy energy burst measurement;impulsive audible sound;peak amplitude;signal interference classification;time domain analysis,,,,,,,,May 15 1964,,IEEE,IEEE Standards

IEEE Std 802.2-1985 provides a description of the peer-to-peer protocol procedures that are defined for the transfer of information and control between any pair of data link layer service access points on a local area network. To satisfy a broad range of potential applications, two types of data link control operation are included. They are: a data-link-connectionless service across a data link with minimum protocol complexity, and a data-link-connection-oriented service across a data link comparable to existing data link control procedures provided in national and international standards. Two distinct 'classes' of LLC operation are identified. Class I provides data-link-connectionless service only and Class II provides data-link-connection-oriented service plus data-link-connectionless service.<<ETX>>",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1984.82775,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=30705,,Local area networks;Protocols;Standards,local area networks;protocols;standards,IEEE Std 802.2-1985;data-link-connectionless service;local area network;logical link control sublayer;medium access control;protocol,,1,7,6,,,,1984,,IEEE,IEEE Standards
