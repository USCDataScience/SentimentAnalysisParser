ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-5 defines Keyword-Driven Testing, which is an approach to describing test cases in a modular way. This standard explains the main concepts and attributes of Keyword-Driven Testing and is applicable to all those who want to create keyword-driven test specifications, create corresponding frameworks, or build test automation based on keywords. This standard defines requirements on frameworks for Keyword-Driven Testing to enable test engineers to share their test artefacts, such as test cases, test data, keywords, or complete test specifications. It also defines minimum requirements for tools supporting Keyword-Driven Testing and defines requirements on a common data exchange format to ensure that tools from different vendors can exchange their data (e.g. test cases, test data and test results).",,Electronic:978-1-5044-0874-5,10.1109/IEEESTD.2016.7750539,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7750539,,IEC Standards;IEEE Standards;ISO Standards;Software engineering,IEC standards;IEEE standards;ISO standards;automatic testing;program testing;program verification;systems engineering,ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 Software Testing standards;ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-5:2016(E);ISO/IEC/IEEE International Standard;data exchange format;keyword-driven test specifications;software engineering;systems engineering;test automation,,,,,,,,Nov. 15 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Standards,

These limits and levels are representative of current practice and user needs. Emission limits are specified by national and international standards bodies. Emission limits for the most part are regulated and hence controlled, which is the case in the U.S. and Canada. Such regulatory limits take precedence, even if the limits are different from those considered in this document. For product immunity, while in some parts of the world this is regulated, for the U.S. and Canada, it is not regulated except for some types of safety equipment. In this way, adequate immunity is more a quality aspect of the product because it does not operate in its intended RF environment, the user would deem it of poor design and quality. The immunity test levels described in this document are representative of common levels applied internationally. However, severe environments (in which levels of electromagnetic disturbance are high) require the consideration of applying higher test levels. This consideration is described in this recommended practice. Finally, it should be noted that the entire recommended practice does not contain normative requirements, as such practices remain optional.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493584,ANSI C63.12;ambient noise levels;atmospheric noise;electromagnetic compatibility (EMC);emissions;galactic noise;immunity;limits;man-made noise;test levels,ANSI Standards;Atmospheric measurements;Electromagnetic compatibility;Electromagnetic measurements;Emissions;Noise measurement,,,,,,,,,,Jan. 29 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Standards,

American National Standard Guide for Protective Relaying of Utility - Consumer Interconnections,,,ANSI/IEEE C37.95-1973,20160330,1972,,,1,45,"This guide has been prepared to aid in the effective and uniform application of fuses, relays, and their associated switching equipment located at the point of interconnection between the utility and the consumer electrical systems. Descriptions of the various devices, definitions of terms, and references to other technical technical publications have been included to make the guide useful not only to relay engineers, but also to other technical people who may not be intimately familiar with the art of relaying, but who nevertheless have a responsibility for the installation and operation of such interconnections. It includes examples for relaying of typical installations, both with and without consumer generation, and with service from utility radial or loop feeders, either directly from the utility substation bus or from a transmission line. It is expected that the guide will be used by consulting engineers, utility relay and sales engineers, and by consumer engineering and maintenance personnel. The scope of this guide does not include the subject of lightning protection for electrical systems as provided by shielding or lightning arrester devices. Lightning is, of course, often the cause of short circuits on power systems, but only the clearing of these short circuits through the use of protective devices is within the scope of this guide. Reference material pertaining to lightning protection may be found in (1) IEEE Std 28-1972, Surge Arresters for AC Power Circuits (ANSI C62.1-1971) (2) ANSI C62.2-1969, Guide for Application of Valve-Type Arresters for AC Systems. This guide does not establish standards or recommendations with regard to personnel safety at the interconnection area with respect to ground-voltage-rise, transferred-potential, step-potential, and touch-potential considerations for faults on the utility system or on the consumer's system.

IEEE Standard Definitions of Basic Per Unit Quantities for Alternating- Current Rotating Machines,,,IEEE Std 86-1975 (Revision of IEEE Std 86-1961),20160323,1975,,,1,10,"When machine parameters are expressed in a properly selected per-unit system, the parameters of a wide range of machine sizes fall into relatively narrow ranges even though the actual values of these same parameters may vary over extremely wide ranges. The per-unit system thereby makes possible an easy comparison between different machines, essentially independent of size, without the use of conversion factors, and facilitates the identification of gross calculation errors. The proper selection of base values is fundamental to the usefulness of a per-unit system. Although per-unit quantities have been used for many years by designers of rotating machinery, the base quantities were not standardized, and it was necessary to define them in each publication. A working group of the Rotating Machinery Committee was created to propose a set of standard definitions. In 1961, a proposed standard (AIEE No. 86) was published for trial use. A critical review of that proposed standard has resulted in this present standard.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1975.7439719,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439719,,AC machines;Current measurement;IEEE Standards;Power generation;Reactive power;Rotating machines;Synchronous generators;Torque control,AC machines;IEEE standards,IEEE Std 86-1975;IEEE standard definitions;alternating-current rotating machines;basic per unit quantities;gross calculation errors,,,,,,,,April 29 1975,,IEEE,IEEE Standards,

IEEE Standard Test Procedure for Measuring Longitudinal Balance of Telephone Equipment Operating in the Voice Band,,,ANSI/IEEE Std 455-1976,20160301,1976,,,1,16,"Telephone companies and equipment manufacturers have generally agreed on a definition for longitudinal balance for many years. This agreement extends also to the basic approach followed when measuring balance. Testing a device for balance involves the application of a longitudinal voltage. Then any resulting metallic voltage is measured, and the ratio of the two voltages is used to develop a balance number.Unfortunately, agreement has ended at about this point. A number of different test circuits are used by different segments of the telephone industry. Although all of the existing test circuits have some merits supporting their use, the mere existence of varied circuits leads to differences in test results.In addition to differences related to the test set, test conditions and procedures can also affect the result. When an item of equipment is to be tested, there is often a test set or procedure,or both, capable of giving any desired result.Agreement on one way of testing for longitudinal balance has been sought. This standard represents such agreement. It defines the basic requirements of a standard test circuit. Reasonable tolerances are included so that a test-set designer will find considerable latitude to make the set his own way. Besides defining the requirements for a test circuit, this standard includes test conditions and procedures that must be established and followed. As a result, all test sets designed and used in accordance with the standard will produce the same balance number for a given test specimen. Similarly, comparing balance numbers for different devices will become more meaningful when all come from tests meeting the standard.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1976.7422618,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422618,,Attenuation measurement;IEEE Standards;Longitudinal balance;Speech processing;Telehone equipment,ANSI standards;IEEE standards;balances;circuit testing;telephone equipment;voltage measurement,ANSI-IEEE 455-1976 standard;IEEE standard test procedure;circuit testing;equipment manufacturer;longitudinal balance measurement;metallic voltage measurement;telephone company;telephone equipment;telephone industry;voice band,,,,,,,,Sept. 30 1976,,IEEE,IEEE Standards,

Gas tube devices are used to provide overvoltage protection in electrical circuits. When the gas tube's breakdown voltage is exceeded, the tube's normal high impedance state changes to a low impedance state to allow the gas tube to conduct the surge discharge current. After the tube conducts the surge discharge current, it interrupts the flow of power follow current and returns to its high impedance state. This standard's test criteria and definitions provide a common engineering language beneficial to user and manufacturer of gas tube surge-protective devices.

IEEE Standard Method of Measuring Recorded Flux of Magnetic Sound Records at Medium Wavelengths,,,IEEE Std 347-1972 (ANSI S4.6-1973),20160218,1972,,,1,8,"The knowledge of the recorded signal amplitude on a magnetic record (which may be in the form of a tape, a disc, oÒÜ a perforated film) has several practical uses: (1) for determining and standardizing references for the levels of audio programs on these magnetic records; (2) for specifying the recording-performance properties of magnetic media (for example, the distortion versus flux, etc); and (3) for measuring and specifying the sensitivity of reproducing heads (and also, by reciprocity, recording heads). The quantity for specifying the recorded signal is the short-circuit magnetic flux, sometimes simply shortened to flux. Several possible methods exist for measuring tape flux, but the measurement given here involves only the use of a calibrated ring-core head which is described in the reference of the standard. Note that the present standard measurement is only for ""medium wavelengths"". A further standard method for measuring short-circuit flux at long wavelengths and at short wavelengths - that is, the ""frequency response"" of the flux on a magnetic record - is under consideration. The technique utilizing a calibrated ring-core head to measure directly the flux at medium wavelengths is superior to magnetometer methods and to ""single turn head"" methods which have been used in the past because the head is easily manufactured using highly perfected commercial methods. The transducer (head) is commercially available to any laboratory at a reasonable cost; it is easily used, and requires no specialized auxiliary equipment. A further advantage of this method over magnetometer methods is the elimination of the errors inherent in making the ""transfer"" recording which is necessary for a magnetometer measurement. This standard represents the joint efforts of the Recording and Reproducing Standards Subcommittee of the Standards Committee of IEEE Group on Audio and Electroacoustics and the Sound Engineering Committee of the Society of Motion Picture and Television En- ineers. It was originally prepared by an SMPTE Ad Hoc Committee as a method of measurement of flux on magnetic sound tracks used in motion-picture films, and was later modified for measurement of recorded flux in any form of magnetic sound record at medium wavelengths. This standard specifies a method of measuring the recorded flux per unit width of a magnetically recorded test signal at medium wavelengths for all magnetic sound record formats. It also specifies the equipment needed to implement this method.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1972.7409897,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7409897,,ANSI Standards;Calibration;Frequency measurement;IEEE Standards;Magnetic flux;Magnetic head;Voltage measurement;Wavelength measurement,IEEE standards;audio recording;magnetic flux;magnetic recording;magnetic tapes;magnetic variables measurement;magnetometers,IEEE Group on Audio and Electroacoustics;IEEE Std 347-1972;IEEE standard method;Recording and Reproducing Standards Subcommittee;Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers;Sound Engineering Committee;audio programs;magnetic sound record formats;magnetic sound records;magnetometer measurement;medium wavelengths;recorded flux measurement;reproducing head sensitivity;tape flux measurement;transducer head,,,,,,,,Oct. 25 1972,,IEEE,IEEE Standards,

IEEE Standard Technical Specifications of a DC Quick Charger for Use with Electric Vehicles,,,IEEE Std 2030.1.1-2015,20160205,2016,,,1,97,"Direct-current (dc) charging is a method of charging that facilitates rapid energy transfer from the electric grid to plug-in vehicles. This method of charging allows significantly more current to be drawn by the vehicle versus lower rated alternating-current (ac) systems. A combination of vehicles that can accept high-current dc charge and the dc supply equipment that provides it has led to the use of terminology such as fast charging, fast charger, dc charger, quick charger, etc. DC charging and ac charging vary by the location at which ac current is converted to dc current. For typical dc charging, the current is converted at the off-board charger, which is separate from the vehicle. For ac charging, the current is converted inside the vehicle, by means of an on-board charger. The location of the ac to dc conversion equipment, or converter, shapes the complexity of the equipment design. Regarding ac charging, as previously mentioned, the conversion is on boardthe vehicle. This allows the original equipment maker (OEM) designed systems to control the charging operation in its entirety. The on-board charger (converter) and battery controller solutionis under direct control of the vehicle manufacturer. For dc charging, an entirely new challenge exists for OEMs. The dc charger is now external to the vehicle and requires the vehicle engineers to control an external power device.

American National Standard Recommended Practice for Electromagnetic Compatibility Limits and Test Levels,,,ANSI C63.12-2015 (Revision of ANSI C63.12-1999),20160129,2016,,,1,46,"A rationale and recommendations for developing emission limits and immunity test levels are presented in this recommended practice. These limits and levels are representative of current practice and user needs. Emission limits are specified by national and international standards bodies. Emission limits for the most part are regulated and hence controlled, which is the case in the U.S. and Canada. Such regulatory limits take precedence, even if the limits are different from those considered in this document. For product immunity, while in some parts of the world this is regulated, for the U.S. and Canada, it is not regulated except for some types of safety equipment. In this way, adequate immunity is more a quality aspect of the product because it does not operate in its intended RF environment, the user would deem it of poor design and quality. The immunity test levels described in this document are representative of common levels applied internationally.

The qualifier, reactance, is more frequently applied to circuits in which the variable element is an easily identified lumped reactance. The qualifier, parametric, is more frequently applied to electron beam and distributed parameter devices, but can include the variable reactance devices as well.

Finally, the ratio of the maximum excursions of the apertures in the horizontal and vertical directions of the transmitted picture, i.e., the aspect ratio, should be the same at both the transmitter and receiver. If there is departure from any of these conditions, geometric distortion results (except in the trivial case where the transmitter and receiver happen to contain compensating errors).

In general, the definitions assume that the antenna is not located in a medium such as a plasma, salt water, or the earth. In such cases, careful evaluation may be necessary to determine whether the term is applicable and how it can be properly employed. For terms that are quantitative it is understood that frequency must be specified. Those terms in which phase or polarization is a significant part of the definition imply a coherent source of power.

In the first place, the scope of the rules has been changed to include all rotating electrical machinery forming a part of the power equipment of electrically-propelled railway cars and locomotives (including trolley, gasoline-electric and oil-electric coaches). In the second place, it has been found desirable to add new rules covering principally, rating, commutation, and over speed tests. In the third place, the old rules must be brought up-to-date as modern methods of ventilating electrical machinery have changed the situation in many respects.

Content management allows an organization to control the storage and retrieval of content objects, track content revisions, maintain a content audit trail, and enable a collaborative environment. Component content management supports the reuse of content objects among deliverables and supports multiple deliverable formats. Content objects that are unique and are maintained as independent database objects are efficient to review, approve, and update; may be combined to produce multiple deliverables; and are cost-effective to translate. The standard defines the characteristics of an effective and efficient process through which content is gathered, managed, and published, including the requirements of a system that is supported by an electronic database. Such a database should support documents or topics and content units that may be assembled to produce complete documents for print, electronic output, or content collections published through electronic media. This database is defined as a component content management system (CCMS), as distinct from a document management system. The objective of component content management is to create content objects once and use them through linking mechanisms in multiple output formats including but not limited to documents. Systems conforming to this standard can fulfill business needs for content development and management, especially the need for a single source of authoritative information. The standard includes business case considerations for acquisition of a content management system. This International Standard is independent of the software tools and markup languages that may be used to manage documentation content, and applies to both printed documentation and on-screen documentation.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.2015.7106441,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106441,26531;component content management system;content management;single source documentation,Content management;Document management;IEC Standards;IEEE Standards;ISO Standards;Software engineering;Systems engineering and theory,content management;document handling;product life cycle management;software engineering;system documentation;systems engineering,CCMS;IEC international standard;IEEE international standard;ISO international standard;authoritative information;collaborative environment;component content management system;content audit trail;content development;electronic database;electronic media;international standard;linking mechanisms;markup languages;on-screen documentation;printed documentation;product life-cycle;service management system documentation;software engineering;software tools;systems engineering,,0,,,,,,May 15 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Standards,management

These techniques are generally applicable only in the far field, but reasonably accurate measurements can be made whenever the following necessary conditions are satisfied.

(2) The receiving antenna must be at least several 'aperture diameters' removed from the transmitting antenna and any scattering objects. (3) The transmitting antenna and any sources of multipath scattering must be contained within the main beam of the receiving antenna.

ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 specifies minimum requirements for the structure and contents of an assurance case to improve the consistency and comparability of assurance cases and to facilitate stakeholder communications, engineering decisions, and other uses of assurance cases. An assurance case includes a top-level claim for a property of a system or product (or set of claims), systematic argumentation regarding this claim, and the evidence and explicit assumptions that underlie this argumentation. Arguing through multiple levels of subordinate claims, this structured argumentation connects the top-level claim to the evidence and assumptions. Assurance cases are generally developed to support claims in areas such as safety, reliability, maintainability, human factors, operability, and security, although these assurance cases are often called by more specific names, e.g. safety case or reliability and maintainability (R&M) case. ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 does not place requirements on the quality of the contents of an assurance case and does not require the use of a particular terminology or graphical representation. Likewise, it places no requirements on the means of physical implementation of the data, including no requirements for redundancy or co-location.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.2011.6045293,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6045293,IEEE 15026-2;adoption;argument;assurance case;claim;dependability;evidence;property;reliability;safety;security;software assurance;software engineering;system assurance;systems engineering,IEC standards;IEEE standards;ISO standards;Quality assurance;Software engineering;Software reliability,IEC standards;IEEE standards;ISO standards;software quality;software standards;systems analysis,IEEE standard;ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011;software assurance;software engineering;systems assurance;systems engineering,,2,,5,,,,Oct. 11 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Standards,software

IEEE Standard for Reduced-Pin and Enhanced-Functionality Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture,,,IEEE Std 1149.7-2009,20100217,2010,,,1,985,"This specification describes circuitry that may be added to an integrated circuit to provide access to on-chip test access ports (TAPs) specified by IEEE Std 1149.1ÎèÎè-2001. The circuitry uses IEEE 1149.1-2001 as its foundation, providing complete backward compatibility, while aggressively adding features to support test and applications debug. It defines six classes of 1149.7 test access ports (TAP.7s), T0-T5, with each class providing incremental capability, building on that of the lower level classes. Class TO provides the behavior specified by 1149.1 from startup when there are multiple on-chip TAPs. Class T1 adds common debug functions and features to minimize power consumption. Class T2 adds operating modes that maximize scan performance. It also provides an optional hot-connection capability to prevent system corruption when a connection is made to a powered system.

IEEE Standard for Design and Verification of Low Power Integrated Circuits,,,IEEE Std 1801-2009,20090403,2009,,,1,218,"The power supplied to elements in an electronic design affects the way circuits operate. Although this is obvious when stated, today's set of high-level design languages have not had a consistent way to concisely represent the regions of a design with different power provisions, nor the states of those regions or domains. This standard provides an HDL-independent way of annotating a design with power intent. In addition, the level-shifting and isolation between power domains may be described for a specific implementation, from high-level constraints to particular configurations. When the logic in a power domain receives different power supply levels, the logic state of portions of the design may be preserved with various state-retention strategies.

IEEE Standard Reference Designations for Electrical and Electronics Parts and Equipments,,,IEEE Std 200-1975,20080403,1975,,,1,28,"This revision added paragraphs on repeated circuits, selected and matched parts, and designation of deposited components on hybrid printed circuits. An appendix B was added covering the Item Designation system of IEC Publication 113-2. Supplement A of 1970 was incorporated into the text, along with minor clarifications and updating of references. Significant changes are marked by vertical black bars in the margin, adjacent to the changed text. The 1968 revision and its 1970 Supplement coordinated the title with the terms used in related standards, added the class letter U, identified names approved in the Federal Item Identification Guide (H6-1), and transferred the class letter list to IEEE Std 315 (ANSI Y32.2). The original issue of this standard was prepared by Subcommittee 16 on Reference Designations, appointed by Sectional Committee Y32 on Graphic Symbols and Designations for the purpose of preparing standard reference designations in the field of electrical and electronic equipment. Early work on reference designations, of the type herein standardized as the Unit Numbering Method, was done by the Symbols Committee of the Institute of Radio Engineers and was published in 1949 as Standards on Designations for Electrical, Electronic and Mechanical Parts and their Symbols, 49 IRE 21.SI. In 1951 the U.S. Department of Defense issued MIL-STD-16 which closely resembled the IRE Standard and acknowledged the pioneering work of the IRE Symbols Committee in this field. In order to minimize confusion, intensive and successful efforts have since been made to coordinate the two standards throughout their subsequent revisions. The work on this standard was greatly facilitated by the constant participation of representatives of the Department of Defense and the IEEE Symbols Committee. As in MIL-SfD-16C, the original Block Numbering Method of assigning reference designations has been deleted in favor of the more flexible and universally applicable Unit Numbering Method, whic- is retained, with minor modifications, in Section 4 of this standard. The explanation of the Block Numbering Method appearing as Appendix A does not form a part of this standard, but is retained for reference in connection with existing equipment on which it was used. The subcommittee was assigned the task of standardizing means for physically locating, through a form of reference designation, the parts and divisions of an equipment. The Location Numbering Method in Section 5 and the Location Coding Method in Section 6 of this standard are based on existing industry practices which have been successfully used to facilitate manufacture and service of complex apparatus by providing such locating means. They are especially useful in designs making multiple use of identical or closely similar parts of subassemblies.",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1975.4483758,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483758,Symbols;designations;equipment;parts;reference,,ANSI standards;IEEE standards;printed circuits,ANSI Y32.16-1975;ANSI standard;IEEE Std 200-1975;IEEE standard;block numbering method;electrical equipment;electrical parts;electronics equipment;electronics parts;hybrid printed circuits;location coding method;location numbering method;reference designations;subassemblies;unit numbering method,,0,,,,,,Dec. 30 1975,,IEEE,IEEE Standards,equipment

IEEE Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems,,,IEEE Std 1547-2003,20030826,2003,,,1,28,"This standard is the first in the 1547 series of interconnection standards and is a benchmark milestone demonstrating the open consensus process for standards development. Traditionally, utility electric power systems (EPS--grid or utility grid) were not designed to accommodate active generation and storage at the distribution level. As a result, there are major issues and obstacles to an orderly transition to using and integrating distributed power resources with the grid. The lack of uniform national interconnection standards and tests for interconnection operation and certification, as well as the lack of uniform national building, electrical, and safety codes, are understood. IEEE Std 1547 and its development demonstrate a model for ongoing success in establishing additional interconnection agreements, rules, and standards, on a national, regional, and state level. IEEE Std 1547 has the potential to be used in federal legislation and rule making and state public utilities commission (PUC) deliberations, and by over 3000 utilities in formulating technical requirements for interconnection agreements for distributed generators powering the electric grid. This standard focuses on the technical specifications for, and testing of, the interconnection itself. It provides requirements relevant to the performance, operation, testing, safety considerations, and maintenance of the interconnection. It includes general requirements, response to abnormal conditions, power quality, islanding, and test specifications and requirements for design, production, installation evaluation, commissioning, and periodic tests.

It was developed to overcome present difficulties in the interpretation of electric generating unit performance data from various systems and to facilitate comparisons among different systems. The standard should also make possible the future exchange o meaningful data among systems in North America and throughout the world. Scope: This document standardizes terminology and indexes for reporting electric generating unit reliability, availability, and productivity performance measures. A generating unit includes all equipment up to the high-voltage terminal of the generator step-up transformer. Reliability in this standard encompasses measures of the ability of generating units to perform their intended function. Availability measures are concerned with the fraction of time a unit is capable of providing service, and account for outage frequency and duration. Productivity measures are concerned with the total power produced by a plant with respect to its potential power production. Therefore, productivity measures consider magnitude of outage as well as frequency and duration of outage. NOTE This standard was developed for application at the unit level; the definitions are applicable below the unit level in most cases. There are some exceptions, however, such as the definition of in service, which applies only at the unit level.

The title was changed because the same amplifiers used for semiconductor detectors are applicable to other types. In this standard, measuring procedures are given in greater detail because with modern amplifiers, perceived performance often depends on the details of measurement. Tests that are specific to amplifiers with time-variant pulse-shaping filters are not included, nor are tests for pile-up rejectors. Time-variant filters allow shorter pulse-shaping times than linear filters for the same signal-to-noise ratio, and pile-up rejectors block pulses that overlap earlier ones, allowing higher count rates for a given spectral-line resolution. Both techniques have the greatest application at very low energies because wide pulses must be used to optimize the SNR, and at high energies where detector artifacts cause low-side tailing of spectrum lines. The pulse width at 50% of peak amplitude is the main amplifier indicator of shaping time because this parameter best allows a performance comparison among different amplifiers. Compared with other parameters, this one is the easiest to measure accurately with an oscilloscope and pulse generator.<<ETX>>",,,10.1109/IEEESTD.1989.101065,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=159348,,Electronic equipment testing;Proportional counters;Pulse amplifiers;Radiation detectors;Scintillation detectors;Semiconductor radiation detectors;Standards,electronic equipment testing;preamplifiers;proportional counters;pulse amplifiers;radiation detection and measurement;scintillation counters;semiconductor counters;standards,IEEE Standard;amplifiers;measuring procedures;performance comparison;pile-up rejectors;preamplifiers;proportional detectors;scintillation detectors;semiconductor detectors;test procedures,,2,1,3,,,,1989,,IEEE,IEEE Standards,
